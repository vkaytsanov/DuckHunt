**TODO:**

Create input processor that will announce when an event from the SDL Event API
occurs to be processed by the current screen and user interface.
Now it is recognized but when you click too fast with the mouse.

If we want world coordinates, a camera needs to be implemented with the needed matrixes
that will create the transformation from screen coordinates to world coordinates.

Pros:
- all the rendering will occur equally good on all window sizes

Cons:
- too much work
