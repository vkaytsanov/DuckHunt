**TODO:**

- In Trello: https://trello.com/b/kFtJmwOx/duck-hunt



- If we want world coordinates, a camera needs to be implemented with the needed matrixes
that will create the transformation from screen coordinates to world coordinates.

    -   Pros:
        - all the rendering will occur equally good on all window sizes

    -   Cons:
        - too much work
